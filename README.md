Idea : Docker GUI (MODIFIED)

Abstract:

Creating a GUI to make docker use really simple. It lets the user run docker container, without having the user to type all the traditional docker commands like docker run, etc. This frees the user from remembering all the docker commands. The fullstack application will contain a login, signup and a dashboard page. The user once, logged in can access the dashboard and run its own docker containers using the GUI.
