Idea 1: Medication assistance and safety for Alzheimer patients MODIFIED ## 

Abstract

“Alzheimer's is a type of dementia that causes problems with memory, thinking and behavior. Symptoms usually develop slowly and get worse over time, becoming severe enough to interfere with daily tasks.”[1] 

Addressing the problem: 

Alzheimer patients have a history of facing severe health disasters because of missed medications. Patients with Alzheimer live an average of eight years after their symptoms are noticeable to others, which is a concerningly small span of time.

There are 3 main things Alzheimer patients need help for:

-	Proper organization of their medicines and pills
-	Regular and appropriate reminders for medication
-	Information about the quantity of pills available with them and reminders for refilling.

Proposed Solution:

The pill boxes available in the market solve the problem of patients for organization of medicines quite a bit, but Alzheimer patients need much more than medicine organization.The solution for all the addressed problems can be an IOT device which solves each of the problems for the patients, and eventually reducing health risks for the patients. A Raspberry Pi model can be used to get medicine data from the pill boxes, sending the data to cloud, evaluating the data and finally simplify the situation for the patient.

Methodology:

-	Raspberry Pi weight sensors placed in each cell of pill organizer
-	Data is deployed to online server or cloud
-	Data is sent to application on patient’s phone
-	Patient is notified for any activity required

Idea 2: Docker GUI

Abstract:

Creating a GUI to make docker use really simple. It lets the user run docker container, without the use of docker run , etc commands. Simulation of docker commands into one web oe desktop application. Since there is a desktop application known as kitematic for Linux and Mac OS, we would be creating a similar application for Windows OS.
