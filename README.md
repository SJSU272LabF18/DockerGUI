Idea 1: Docker GUI (MODIFIED)

Abstract:

Creating a GUI to make docker use really simple. It lets the user run docker container, without the use of docker run , etc commands. Simulation of docker commands into one web oe desktop application. Since there is a desktop application known as kitematic for Linux and Mac OS, we would be creating a similar application for Windows OS.

Idea 2: Medication assistance and safety for Alzheimer patients (MODIFIED) 

Abstract

“Alzheimer's is a type of dementia that causes problems with memory, thinking and behavior. Symptoms usually develop slowly and get worse over time, becoming severe enough to interfere with daily tasks.”[1] 

Addressing the problem: 

Alzheimer patients have a history of facing severe health disasters because of missed medications. Patients with Alzheimer live an average of eight years after their symptoms are noticeable to others, which is a concerningly small span of time.

There are 3 main things Alzheimer patients need help for:

-	Proper organization of their medicines and pills
-	Regular and appropriate reminders for medication
-	Information about the quantity of pills available with them and reminders for refilling.

Proposed Solution: (Updated)

    1. To measure the weight of the pills, micro-load cells can be placed in the pill boxes for getting a total count of pills in each section.
    2. The caretaker of the patient is notified for the time of current and next medication.
    3. The caretaker is also alerted if the pill box needs to be refilled.
