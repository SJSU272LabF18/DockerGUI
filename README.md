### Hills Statement:

*Docker GUI is a desktop application created for students and employees who deal with docker containers in their current curriculum/business operations. The application is designed in such a way that it provides the user to view the list of running containers/images, create new containers, start/stop/restart containers, exec into containers and view logs on the UI without using the command line. Since remembering a humungous list of docker commands is not easy, this application provides its user to carry out these commands via simple mouse clicks. Itâ€™s mainly focused for students who need to complete their assignments in time and it becomes frustrating to troubleshoot problems with the applications running on docker containers. The application is also helpful to DevOps engineers making their tasks at work easier.*

2. CSS
3. JavaScript - nodeJS, shellJS, React, Redux
